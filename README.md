You've all seen websites where you can enter some javascript and the page runs it, and maybe tells you if there are any errors. Back when I taught a front-end web development class, I decided to do something similar to use for homework; but I wanted to check not only if the code worked, but also how the code was written. I also wanted to do the same for HTML and CSS. To do this I took node modules for style checking, linting, abstract syntax tree parsing; combined it with unit testing; and created a browser friendly wrapper with a single API. With this you can test anything from whether the code works down to if the student used a hex code to set a background color. To see it in action check out the samples below:

Example Application (Rinzai is just the API for testing the solutions, the rest of the page is not part of the API):

* JavaScript: http://shiftyp.github.io/fewd6/exercises/?test=javascript
* CSS: http://shiftyp.github.io/fewd6/exercises/?test=css_basics
* HTML: http://shiftyp.github.io/fewd6/exercises/?test=html_basics
